During the testing phase of the second iteration of the cell board, the digital 
isolator was compromised due to 6.5 V being present on the 5 V rail. A mistake in 
the PCB was that the collector and the base pins of the linear regulator transistors
were swapped, providing the overvoltage to the isoltaor. A simple fix was available 
by desoldering the digital isolator from the first iteration PCB and replacing it 
with the broken one.
