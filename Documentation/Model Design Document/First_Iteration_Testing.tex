The first PCBA was deemed unusable shortly after beginning the 
testing phase. When applying power to the input of the board, 
there was no voltage reaching the isolated converter. After a 
short investigation, it was found that the layers of the PCB 
were misaligned during the production process, so the vias did 
not have proper connections. Thus, no power was able to reach the 
circuit so the team decided to stop testing 
the board. To avoid this issue for future iterations, the team 
ordered the next PCB from an external supplier.
