things fall beyond the scope of this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Battery management system (BMS) research, This project will not research on how a BMS
    functions apart from the in and outputs a BMS typically has.
    \item BMS design, The project will not design or in any way or form create a BMS.
    \item User Interface(UI), The project will not include a UI to control the Hardware. 
    The hardware emulator will be controlled by adjusting the firmware.
    \item The research paper will only focus on our design work and future 
    specifications of a battery emulator.
\end{itemize}
