BMS development strongly depends on simulation models of the target
battery cells, battery pack and the BMS itself. In addition to adequate modelling 
of the battery pack and BMS, acquiring hands-on experience with related
hardware is needed for e.g. model validation and the verification of 
researchoutcomes using actual systems.

The focus of this paper is to showcase the research and design process of 
a battery hardware emulator, which is to be used in testing newly developed 
battery management systems. The design process is iterative and modular, 
making the project to be easily picked up and firther developed and improved 
by other people.
