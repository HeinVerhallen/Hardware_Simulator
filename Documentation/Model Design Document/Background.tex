{E}{nergy} storage is one of the grand technological challenges posed by the transformation from a
fossil fuel dependent society to one that relies on renewable energy sources. Batteries provide
some good solutions to these challenges, however, the present battery technologies suffer from
high weight, short lifetime, long charging time and limited safety.

The BatteryNL consortium is focused on developing the next generation of more efficient
batteries with enhanced performance. Fontys Engineering is helping BatteryNL with the development 
of an optimized battery management system (BMS), which can be quite
hazardous when testing. Modern batteries can store a lot of energy, and if they catch fire, can be difficult to
extinguish. In addition to that, an insufficiently tested BMS can pose a hazard to users and to
the environment.

The solution to that is to emulate the battery and the load, so that testing can be completed
under a wide range of conditions without taking excessive risks.

This document explains in detail the development process of this project. 
Architecture, hardware, software, testing and results are covered for every design 
iteration of the process. 

The design is based on the 14-cell slider battery pack emulator kit by 
NXP \cite{UM11349}.
