\subsubsection{Sourcing Current}
For this second iteration the low power of the shelf linear regulator has been 
replaced with a custom discrete 12 A adjustable linear regulator based on the 
LT3080-1 from Linear Technologies.

The first thoughts were to make a fully discrete solution but since the low 
permitted forward voltage drop of the regulator combined with the big output 
current and relatively big range made it really challenging to get it stable 
under all operating conditions. For this several hours of LTspice simulations 
have been performed to in the end move to a design using an off-the-shelf IC as 
driver for a high power transistor shown in \hl{insert ref to LTspice SCH image here}.

The working of the circuit is as follows, xx

Two of these identical circuits are placed in parallel with thier set pins tied 
together so they are at the same potential. To accomodate proper current sharing 
two 20 m$\tcohm$ series resistors have been added to give some feedback.
