{T}{he} ability to test battery management systems is crucial 
to their development and the improvement of battery technologies,
which is a field with a great significance for the transition
from fossil fuels to renewable energy. 

As this the field of focus of the BatteryNL consortium, the
battery hardware emulator is an important project, aiming to 
ensure safety and steady development of the field. 

The project still has challenges to overcome, however, steady progress
has been achieved and a proof of concept for a single cell emulator, including 
current sourcing and sinking is completed. Modular design approach was used 
which ensures future work on the project can be easily done in a clear 
manner, with an iterative process and easy scaling up of the number of cells.
