{F}{or} future development of this project, the main points of improvement would be 
to look into fixing the data transition of the USB to UART chip, and make the 
bootloading lines available on the board, so as to ensure proper programming and 
running process of the microcontroller. 

When the model board is fully functional, it should be tested with multiple cells, 
expecting a steady behavior at each cell.

A point of improvement after that is adding temperature emulation to the cell board. 
This is another crucial component of BMS testing. Once that is added and completed 
the last part needed to transform the battery hardware emulator into a full BMS 
tester is implementing a part to the system that would simulate different types of 
loads.
