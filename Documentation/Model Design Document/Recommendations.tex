{F}{or} future development of this project, the main points of improvement would be to look into fixing the 
data transition of the USB to UART chip, and make the bootloading lines available on the board, so as to ensure
proper programming and running process of the mictrocontroller. 

When the model board is fully functional, it should be tested with multiple cells, expecting a steady behaviour at 
each cell.

A point of improvement after that is adding temperature emulation to the cell board. This is another cruical component 
of BMS testing. Once that is added and completed the last part needed to transform the battery hardware emulator into a 
full BMS tester is implementing a part to the system that would simulate diferent types of loads.
