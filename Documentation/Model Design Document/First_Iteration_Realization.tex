A 3D model of the PCB is visible in Fig. \ref{fig:1st_pcb}.
The Fontys laser printer laboratory was used for the production 
of the first batch of PCBs, however, the via pressing equipment in the 
laboratory was incomplete, resulting in faulty connections. 
This deemed the first PCB unusable, therefore the focus was 
immediately shifted to the second iteration, where the PCB 
would be ordered and made externally.
