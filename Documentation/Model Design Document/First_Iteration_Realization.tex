The Fontys laser
printer laboratory was used for the production of the first PCB, however, the via pressing
equipment in the laboratory was incomplete, resulting in a fauty connections. This 
deemed the first PCB unusable, therefore the focus was immediately shifted on the 
second iteration, where the PCB would be ordered and made externally.
