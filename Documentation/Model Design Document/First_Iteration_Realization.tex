The Fontys laser printer laboratory was used for the production 
of the first PCB, however, the via pressingequipment in the 
laboratory was incomplete, resulting in a fauty connections. 
This deemed the first PCB unusable, therefore the focus was 
immediately shifted on the second iteration, where the PCB 
would be ordered and made externally.
