%FILE FOR RISK ANALYSIS
There are many risks and reasons why the project might fail or go bad, A change in organizational priorities is the most common reason. A change in project objectives is also common as poor communication and unclear risk definition.
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
		\item Unclear or shifting goals.
		\item lack of planning.
		\item lack of follow up.
		\item timing issues 
		\item Lack of risk management.
		\item Unsuitable tools.
		\item Too many unsuitable tools
	\end{itemize}

\noindent
For this reason, table \ref{tab:risk_analysis} has been created with ratings that describe the probability of the project experiencing delays due to a specific reason and the corresponding impact. By multiplying these values together, a risk score is generated for each risk. To have a high chance of successfully completing the project, it is not acceptable for this score to be bigger then or equal to ten.
