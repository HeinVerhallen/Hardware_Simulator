The goal of this project is to design a programmable hardware system that presents a BMS with a "battery" and a "load" (see figure \ref{fig:system_context_diagram}). The hardware system emulates the battery and load. By using only software changes the hardware system should be able to emulate a battery with a different chemistry, capacity and cell topology. Likewise the hardware system should be able to emulate different loads from electronics through to motors under varying load.

At the end of the project it is expected that a battery and load emulator prototype is delivered. As well as a research report on existing battery and load emulators and the requirements for future battery and load emulators.
