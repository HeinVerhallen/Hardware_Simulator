\section{Background}
\begin{align}
    Energy storage is one of the grand technological challenges posed by the transformation from the fossil fuel dependent society to one that relies on renewable energy sources. Batteries provide some good solutions to these challenges, however, the present battery technologies suffer from high weight, short lifetime, long charging time and limited safety. 
The BatteryNL consortium is focused on developing the next generation of more efficient batteries with enhanced performance. Fontys Engineering is helping BatteryNL with the development of an optimized battery management system (BMS), testing which can be quite hazardous. Modern batteries can store a lot of energy, and, if they catch fire, can be difficult to extinguish. In addition to that, an insufficiently tested BMS can pose a hazard to users and to the environment. 
The solution to that is to emulate the battery and the load, so that testing can be completed under a wide range of conditions without taking excessive risks.
