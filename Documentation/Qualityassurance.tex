\begin{itemize} 
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
    \item The editor will be Visual Studio VsCode.
    \item The compiler will be MiKTeX
\end{itemize}

The coding will be done using the following tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item VsCode
    \item PlatformIO/Arduino extension
    \item other options?
\end{itemize}

The design and simulation of electronic circuits are made using the following tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LTSpice
    \item KiCad/Altium circuitmaker/other options?
\end{itemize}

In order to make sure that everyone can work simultaneously on documents and code the team wil utilize git with an online repository hosted on github.

Weekly meetings with (preferably) all team members are held to discuss the progress since the previous meeting, possible roadblocks which need to be tackled and choices to be made.
