Since this project is part of the Dutch Battery research project BatteryNL,
additional budget and support are available. You will have access to experts
from the Centre of Expertise HRTech of the Hogeschool Rotterdam (HR) to
discuss technical findings and engineering choices to be made. They have a
battery testing setup that allows validation of battery models against actual
battery performance. You will also be in contact with fellow students from
HR who are working on a battery related project.
